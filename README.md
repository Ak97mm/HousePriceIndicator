# HousePriceIndicator
House Price Indicator
This project is a House Price Indicator built using Linear Regression and Random Forest models. It predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other relevant variables. The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment and is ideal for demonstrating supervised machine learning techniques on structured data.

# 📌 Features
Cleaned and preprocessed housing dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns

Trained and evaluated:

📈 Linear Regression

🌲 Random Forest Regressor

Compared performance of both models

Visualized predictions vs actual prices

Exported trained models (optional, if included)

🧠 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook 📒

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Model Performance
Model	RMSE / MAE / R² (example)
Linear Regression	RMSE: X, R²: Y
Random Forest	RMSE: A, R²: B

(Replace X, Y, A, B with actual evaluation metrics.)
